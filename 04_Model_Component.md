## Models
The Model Component in LangChain is a crucial part of framework, designed to facilitate interactions with various language models and embedding models.

It abstracts the complexity of working directly with different LLMs, chat models and embedding models, providign a uniform interface to communicate with them. This makes it easier to build applications taht rely on AI-Generated text, text embeddings for similarity search, and retrieval augmented generation(RAG).


### Types of Models:
    1. Language Models
        i. LLMs
        ii. Chat Models 
    2. Embedding MOdels

### 1. LLMs
General Purpose models that is used for raw text generation. They take a single(or plain text) as input and returns a string(plain text). These are traditionally older models and are to used much now. 

### 2. Chat Models
Language models taht are specialized for conversational tasks. They take a sequence of messages as inputs and return chat messages as outputs(as opposed to using plain text). These are traditionally newer models and use more in comparison to the LLMs.
